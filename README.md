# A js-scroll-listener sample

A JS scroll listener sample, will animate an HTML element when the element is revealed in the viewport window as the user scrolls down the window.

## Listening to the scrolling window

Using JS and setting up the elements to animate with a data attribute, a window event listener is called and once the distance between the element and the top of the window reaches a certain condition an "active" class state is added to the element.

Then you can use the .active class selector to apply a transition or animation to the HTML element.
